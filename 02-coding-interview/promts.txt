I want to implement a platform for online coding interviews.
The app should be able to do the following:
- Create a link and share it with candidates
- Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
- Show real-time updates to all connected users
- Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Execute code safely in the browser.
everything should be interactive - I can log in, sign up, see my username when I'm logged in
I want you to create separatly frontend and backend services.
Frontend sources should be put in ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-2025/02-coding-interview/frontend/ and backend in ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-2025/02-coding-interview/backend/.
Frontend should be developed with NodeJS and backend - with FastAPI.
Create an OpenAPI specs based on what it needs and put it in swagger.
based on the OpenAPI specs, create fastapi backend for now use a mock database, which we will later replace with a real one.
Frontend and backend should be covered with tests (for backend use pytest) and **размещены** in separate folders.
implement a verify_api.py script that tests the running server to ensure all endpoints work correctly.
Make frontend use backend. use OpenAPI specs for guidance
for init work directory of project use ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-2025/02-coding-interview
follow the guidelines in AGENTS.md
