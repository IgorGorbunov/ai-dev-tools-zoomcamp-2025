I want to implement a platform for online coding interviews.
The app should be able to do the following:
- Create a link and share it with candidates
- Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
- Show real-time updates to all connected users
- Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Execute code safely in the browser
I want you to create separatly frontend and backend services.
Frontend sources should be put in ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-2025/02-coding-interview/frontend/ and backend in ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-2025/02-coding-interview/backend/.
Frontend should be developed with NodeJS and backend - with FastAPI.
Create an OpenAPI specs based on what it needs.
